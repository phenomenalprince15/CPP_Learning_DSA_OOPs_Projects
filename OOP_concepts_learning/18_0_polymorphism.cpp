/*
Polymorphism ::
- It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
- It enables funtions to process objects differently based on their actual derived type, even when those objects are
--- accessed through a pointer or reference of the base class.

Two Types ::
- Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism
--- Achieved using function overloading, operator overloading and templates.
--- The function to be called is resovled at compile time.

- Run-Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism
--- Acheived using inheritance and virtual functions.
--- The function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.
